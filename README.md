# Bad Pic Collage
This app let you make bad collage using your pics. 🚀

## First of All
We start with an example: take, from the web, a picture of your favorite Basket player and them apply you face on his one. 
Is the result very ugly? Good, the main goal of this application is that! 💪

As in the example, you can make ugly collage using every image from the gallery. Do you want to make fun of a friend? Well, put his face over that of a gorilla. 🦍

That's not all because if you want you can type some text, choose font, text dimension, text color and background to improve your beautifull ugly collage. 

Interesting? 🤔
Oh yes. 

Do you want to try?
Just do it. 😍

## Memes
Only for me this would be enough, but I know you are insatiable, so I decided to allow you to choose an image from a list of blank memes. How many memes you can choose? The list shows the most popular 100 memes of the last 30 days. Yes, also this feature is very interesting, doesn't it? 🔥

## At the end
As soon as you've finished editing your beautiful ugly collage you can share with you friends and have fun with them.
So, this app, besides being very funny, it has real social utility: more fun, more friendship, more love and more peace. ☮️

I love it.

## How to call this app?
The official name is BadPicCollage, but you can read BPCollage or BPC (as you can see in the icon). However, if someone call it app-to-make-ugly-collage I'm fine with it anyway. You can also call it Foo-App or Pippo and it would still be good. The important thing is that you download it and have fun with it. ✌️

## Too much emojis?
Yes, I don't care. 😝
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

## Summary
Pick a picture, from gallery, camera or meme list, apply on it every sticker, pics or text you want and share the result image.
Stickers and texsts can be flipped, resized, moved, rotated and deleted (but I think that is a strange case 🎈) 

## Where download this magnificent app?

## Code, Under the hood.
Stop emojis and let's talk about the code. 
The App is very simple beacuse there are 3 important modules on which everything is built on:
 * App module where you can find the Activities and all the other stuff about UX.
 * The android-gesture module, made by [almeros](https://github.com/Almeros/android-gesture-detectors) to handle gesture on the imageview
 * The BadPicCollageImageView module includes the magic about the image and sticker. Special thanks to [UpTech](https://blog.uptech.team/how-to-create-snapchat-like-stickers-for-android-50512957c351)
 
 I love kotlin, so I used this language to code the first and the third modules.
